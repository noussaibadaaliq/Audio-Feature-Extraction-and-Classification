# Audio-Signal-Processing-for-Classification
# Project Overview
This project focuses on audio signal processing to extract relevant features and build a simple audio classification system. The system processes audio files, computes key audio features, and then classifies them based on distances between feature vectors. Specifically, it extracts features such as energy, zero-crossing rate (ZCR), and entropy from audio files, computes distance matrices, and evaluates the performance using precision and recall metrics.


# Audio-Signal-Processing-for-Classification
# Project Overview
This project focuses on audio signal processing to extract relevant features and build a simple audio classification system. The system processes audio files, computes key audio features, and then classifies them based on distances between feature vectors. Specifically, it extracts features such as energy, zero-crossing rate (ZCR), and entropy from audio files, computes distance matrices, and evaluates the performance using precision and recall metrics.

#Features and Components
1. Feature Extraction
Energy (e): Calculates the energy of the audio signal, which measures the intensity of the signal.
Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR): Computes the rate at which the signal changes sign, which is useful for identifying the noisiness of the signal.
Entropy (entropie): Measures the randomness in the audio signal, providing insight into the unpredictability of the sound.
2. Data Preparation
Training Data (stocker_train): Reads and processes audio files from a given directory, extracting the specified features (energy, ZCR, entropy) for each audio file and storing them in a matrix.
Test Data (stocker_test): Similarly reads and processes audio files from a test directory to create a feature matrix for testing.
3. Distance Computation
Distance Matrix (stocke_dist): Computes the Euclidean distance between feature vectors of training and test data to determine similarity.
Sorting and Indexing: The distance matrix is sorted to identify the nearest matches.
4. Pertinent Matching and Evaluation
Pertinent Matching (stocke_pert): Identifies which training samples are considered relevant for each test sample based on the sorted distance matrix.
Precision and Recall Computation: Calculates precision and recall metrics based on the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives to evaluate the classification performance.
5. Metrics and Output
Precision (Precision): Indicates how many of the retrieved audio files are relevant.
Recall (Recall): Measures how many relevant audio files were retrieved.
Average Precision (pr_moy): Computes the average precision over all test instances for a comprehensive evaluation of the classifierâ€™s performance.
# How to Run the Project
Set up the environment: Ensure that Python and necessary libraries (e.g., numpy, scipy) are installed.

Prepare your data: Place the audio files for training in a specified filename directory and test audio files in filename_tst.

Run the feature extraction scripts: Execute the script that runs stocker_train() and stocker_test() to extract features from training and test audio files.

Compute distances and evaluate: Run stocke_dist() to create the distance matrix, and stocke_pert() to evaluate the pertinence and calculate the precision and recall.

Review the output: The script outputs precision and recall values and computes the average precision, which helps assess the effectiveness of the classification.

# Project Dependencies
numpy: For numerical operations and matrix manipulations.
scipy: For signal processing, particularly wavfile for reading audio files.
